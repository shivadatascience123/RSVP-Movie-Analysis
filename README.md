# RSVP-Movie-Analysis
The task at hand is to analyze RSVP's movie database and provide directives based on data driven insights in order to finalize the production house's next film for the global and domestic audience.

#Executive Summary
After analyzing the dataset using SQL, the following insights have been derived and appropriate recommendations are provided, as follows:
1.	RSVP movies should focus on the ‘Drama’ genre, since the past 3 years data shows that Drama had the most number of releases(4,285). Any upcoming ‘Drama’ movies should not be more than 107 minutes.
2.	RSVP can keep options open by exploring the ‘Comedy’ and ‘Thriller’ segment, since they are among the Top 3 genres.
3.	Dream Warrior Pictures and National Theatre Live are ideal partners for RSVP to partner on their next projects due to a good number of HIT movies in past 3 years.
4.	Movies starting with ‘The’ have a high rating of ~8.0 to 9.5; this is a good insight while framing a movie title.
5.	RSVP must partner with Marvel or 20th Century Fox to release a global movie as they are the 2 most popular production houses based on the highest votes for their movies.
6.	James Mangold should be hired as the director of an RSVP movie, preferably in Drama genre.
7.	RSVP can hire actors Mammootty based on high median rating, and choose Vijay Sethupathi, Taapsee Pannu and Parvathy Thiruvothu on the basis of their high weighted average rating based on votes, extensive film industry experience and box-office success.
8.	To ensure that movies with a regional feel do well, RSVP must partner with Star Cinema and Twentieth Century Fox based on their high median rating(>=8) and hit rate with the audience.
